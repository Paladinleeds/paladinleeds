# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Ellie!

I'm a transgender woman trying to break into the software development world.

## What will I be making?

My mainstay work is going to be plugins for the Elgato Stream Deck, potentially along with other brands (however those that aren't by Elgato but use plugins designed for their hardware will not be officially supported). I'll be building a wrapper in order to do this, but this is going to be hosted on the organisation's profile instead.

## What languages do I use?

My favourite language to work with is C# (although I need to get better at it), however I am planning to learn other languages as well.
